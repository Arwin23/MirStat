# MirStat

**Simple tool to analyze miRNA QPCR data**
=======

## Motivation
MirStat is an R script developped to analyse miRNA data obtained by QPCR arrays. It generates a principale component analyse for the first 3 dimensions and a heatmap for each predefined group. Developped for the study:

*Teichenne et al, Transcriptional profile of acinar cells reprogrammed into insulin producing cells, 2015*

## Principle
MirStat.R is a simple R script which analyse QPCR values from a CSV file (see example in /data).
Users can modify the existing groups in the first part of the code so it can match their own sample names. 

**For each group** : For each qPCR 1 NA containing value or all undetermined values trigger its exclusion from the group analysis. The remaining qPCR data are reduced, centered and classified by hierarchical cluster analysis. A principale component analyse is performed with FactoMineR package and summarized by graphs and tables in both idividual and variable spaces. Finally, a distance matrix is generated by the Pearson method and is used to create a heatmap scaled by individual sample thanks to gplots package.

## Get MirStat
### From github repository 
``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/a-slide/MirStat
```
The program must be made executable using *chmod*.
``` bash
$ sudo chmod u+x MirStat.R
```
You may also add the executable to your system PATH

## Usage

First, the R script code had to be edited with your own sample name to create as many group as needed. Just add a new vector line as shown below

```R
# Create a list of group names to analyze data separatly
v1 = c("sample1-1", "sample1-2", "sample1-3", "sample2-1", "sample2-2", "sample2-3")
v2 = c("sample2-1", "sample2-2", "sample2-3", "sample3-1", "sample3-2", "sample3-3")
```

Update the group list and group name vector to match your group names

```R
# Define group list and group names
group.list = list(v1,v2)
names(group.list) = c("sample1 vs sample2", "sample2 vs sample3")
```

Format your **tab separated csv** data sheet as follow:
```  
            qPCR1   qPCR2   qPCR3   ...
sample1-1   0.23    0       12334   ...
sample1-2   12      0       8755    ...
sample1-3   65      0       87545   ...
...         ...     ...     ...     ...
```
See example file in the data folder

Run the script with the data sheet path as only argument
``` bash
Usage: MirStat.R myQPCRresult.csv
```

All file will be generated in the current folder
